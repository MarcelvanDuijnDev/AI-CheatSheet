# AI Terminology
|Terms|Explanation|
|----|----|
|Backpropagation|An algorithm used to calculate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the parameters of a neural network.|
|Bias-Variance Trade-off|A concept that describes the relationship between the complexity of a model and its ability to fit the training data while also generalizing to new, unseen data.|
|Computer Vision|A subfield of AI that deals with the ability of computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, including tasks such as image recognition and object detection.|
|Data Preprocessing|The process of preparing and cleaning the data before feeding it into a model, it includes tasks such as feature extraction, normalization, and handling missing values.|
|Deep Learning|A subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks with many layers to perform tasks such as image or speech recognition.|
|Edge Computing|A method of performing data processing and analysis at the source of data, rather than in a centralized location, such as a data center.|
|Embedding|A technique used to represent discrete data, such as words, in a continuous vector space, making it easier for a model to process and understand.|
|Explainable AI (XAI)|A subfield of AI that aims to make the decision-making process of AI models transparent and interpretable to humans.|
|Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)|A type of deep learning model that consists of two parts, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained together in a competitive manner.|
|Generative Models|A type of model that can generate new data samples that are similar to the training data.|
|Gradient Descent|An optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters that minimize a loss function.|
|Hyperparameter|A value that determines the behavior of a model, but is set by the modeler, not learned from the data.|
|Inference|The process of using a trained model to make predictions or decisions on new data.|
|LLM|Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence tools that can read, summarize and translate texts and predict future words in a sentence letting them generate sentences similar to how humans talk and write.|
|Machine Learning|A method of teaching computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.|
|Model|A mathematical representation of a problem or task, which can be trained and used to make predictions or decisions.|
|Natural Language Processing (NLP)|A subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language, including tasks such as language translation and text summarization.|
|Neural Network|A type of algorithm modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, used for tasks such as image or speech recognition.|
|Overfitting|When a model is trained too well on the training data, and performs poorly on new, unseen data.|
|Regularization|A technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.|
|Reinforcement Learning|A method of machine learning where the model learns by taking actions in an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.|
|Supervised Learning|A method of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the correct output is provided for each input.|
|Training Data|Data used to train a model. It helps the model to learn from examples and improve its performance.|
|Transfer Learning|A technique where a model that has been trained on one task is fine-tuned on a different but related task.|
|Unsupervised Learning|A method of machine learning where the model is not provided with labeled data, and must find patterns or structure in the input data on its own.|
